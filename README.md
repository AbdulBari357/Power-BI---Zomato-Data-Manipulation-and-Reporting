Zomato Data Manipulation and Reporting

This report was developed by consolidating multiple regional datasets into a unified Power BI model to provide a comprehensive view of Zomato’s global restaurant landscape. Data cleaning and transformation were performed to resolve inconsistencies in city names, remove unused fields, and create appropriate dimension tables for countries and cuisines. Interactive visuals were designed to enable drill-down analysis by continent, country, and city, along with insights into restaurant ratings, average costs, and cuisine diversity. The report is structured across multiple pages to ensure clarity, usability, and alignment with Zomato’s business objectives, and is optimized for both web and mobile access.
